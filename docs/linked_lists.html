<h1>Linked lists</h1>

Linked lists are a sequence of items, that are each linked to one another. Random access is
not possible, to reach the item you want, you'll have to walk down the list to get to the
item. Unless you cleverly keep track of it somehow as it is inserted, to get O(1) access
time.
