This project came from OpenGenus's Quark. 

The old project was a chrome extension with so much legacy code, that I found migrating it would
take more time than creating a new Responsive Web App from scratch. And so began this project. 

# To start

Issue

And then `node server.js`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser. 

# Adding things to the search engine
