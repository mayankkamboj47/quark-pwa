Quark is a search engine that can work offline, and emerged from much older, OpenGenus's Quark.  

The old project was a chrome extension with much legacy code, that I found migrating it would
take more time than creating a new Responsive Web App from scratch. And so began this project. 

# To start

Get your copy of the repo, and in the main folder issue,
`npm install`
And then `node server.js`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` on your browser to see the website live. Once loaded, the site will
continue to work when you lose connection. 

# Adding things to the search engine 

Just create a file in the docs folder.
