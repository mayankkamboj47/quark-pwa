Trails of TODOs are littered throughout the code. Just look for TODO in the code. 

Pick one you feel confident about. 
If none of the TODOs feel good to you, create your own that does and work on that. 
Once you are done, you can make a pull request. 

If you are uncertain that the changes you make will be welcome, you can add an
issue beforehand (there is an "issues" tab on Github), and wait for us to respond. 
Don't be afraid to make a mistake, we'll correct you without judgement. 

Talk to mayankkamboj47 (at) gmail to ask any further questions, or if this README
feels too difficult. We'll try to make it less scary for you.
